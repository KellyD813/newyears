  <h1>About</h1>
  <h2>What is the Resolution Project:</h2>
  <p>A year-long project that tracks 9 participants and their 2017 New Year's resolutions.</p>

  <h2>Process:</h2>
  <p>At the end of each month in 2017, an email is sent out with questions to track the participants' resolution progress.</p>
  <p>There are three sets of questions: beginning, middle, and end.</p>
  <p>The "beginning" set, sent in January, asks the participants to declare a resolution.</p>
  <p>The "middle" set, sent February through November, track resolution progress, changes to schedule, and feelings towards resolution completion.</p>
  <p>The "end" set, sent in December, provides a year end checkpoint on the status of the resolution.</p>

  <h2>Effort of participants:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Answer 5-6 questions each month for the next 12 months.</li>
    <li>Be okay with me sharing first names*, ages, professional fields, and any information about their resolutions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>* These can be changed</p>

  <h2>Who are the participants:</h2>
  <p>The participants are people I know who I could reliably get in contact with each month.</p>

  <h2>Motivation for The Resolution Project:</h2>
  <p>Two reasons -</p>
  <ol>
    <li>I am super fascinated by the idea of a New Year resolution. We can decide at any point of the year to make a change in our lives, but the New Year resolution is so powerful. It's the start of a New Year, a new you! </li>
    <li>Using this as an opportunity to stretch my brain as a dev and design project.</li>
  </ol>
