      <h3>How do you feel about the idea of New Year Resolutions?</h3>
      <p>I've actually never really done it before, so I'm looking forward to giving it a try.</p>

      <h3>What is your 2016 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I'm going to participate in more queer and kink community events this year -- at least once a month. I wanna be more open to meeting new people and having new experiences.</p>

      <h3>Do you think you will accomplish this resolution by the end of December 2017?</h3>
      <p>Yes!</p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="feb-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yes! I've been keeping track of upcoming events in the community and making sure that I'm getting out to at least one every month. I've also been looking for opportunities to bring friends along in hopes of fostering some larger sense of community -- with varying levels of success.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>I don't know that it's changed my daily routine, but it's definitely pushed me to be a bit more outgoing than my default nature, which has been really interesting.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Yes! This month a date asked me to a Valentine's Day-themed BDSM party. I was pretty nervous about it, but ended up having a blast with him, hanging out with some pretty cool people, and supporting a new kink community space.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>Not so far. We'll see how well I keep up with it as the year progresses.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely. I already have plans for another party next month.</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>I do feel like having to report to someone at the end of the month, there's another layer of accountability that I wouldn't otherwise have. Interested to see if I still feel that way in a few months.</p>

    <div class="mar-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yeah, as much as I can. I'm a little worried about April -- it's gonna be a busy month so I'm not sure I'll be able to make a ton of progress, but I guess that just means I have to make up for it in May!</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>I don't think it's changed my daily routine, but it has changed what I'm looking out for -- in my dating life, where I want to spend time on the weekends and with who, stuff like that -- for sure.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Yeah, I went to another party this month! It was...not as great as last month, haha. Mostly it was just at a weird place that I didn't like, and it was pretty sparsely attended. I went with a guy I've been seeing for a while now and we had a really great, really intense scene, which was really great. But I don't think it's a party I'll go to again.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>Nope! I'm definitely making the kind of progress I set out to make.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yes!</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Again, I really just think the accountability factor is motivating, which is really cool.</p>

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>April was a pretty rough month for a lot of reasons: work shit, friendship shit, dating shit. My focus definitely slipped a little this month, so unfortunately, I didn't really do much on this goal this month.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Not so much this month. :-/</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Not so much this month. But I do have plans to go to a BDSM party next month with a friend, so I'm looking forward to that. After that, we're heading into the gay high holy days: Pride, Dore Alley, Folsom, so I'm ready to start planning for those!</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>I'm more than a little bummed that this month went the way it did, but I'm eager to make up for it! :D</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Hell yep.</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Kelly, you're a goddamn delight and I do appreciate this monthly check-in. :)</p>
