      <h3>How do you feel about the idea of New Year Resolutions?</h3>
      <p>I think it's a nice sentiment towards self improvement.</p>

      <h3>What is your 2016 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I want to start and maintain a <a href='http://bulletjournal.com/' target='_blank'>bullet journal</a>, ideally working on it several times a week but at minimum once a week. My life isn't that interesting so I can't expect to update it every day and create meaningful content. Mainly it'll give me a chance to practice hand lettering and graphic design/compositions with some direction.</p>

      <h3>Do you think you will accomplish this resolution by the end of December 2017?</h3>
      <p>Knowing my past history with starting/completing projects, I'm not optimistic I will. However, this isn't something that needs to be seen publicly, which is less pressure to make perfect. Hopefully that will make it easier to maintain.</p>

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Nope!</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Not terribly.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Yes and no. I think I initially said I wanted to do more journaling to keep my creativity up. So the physical goal of journaling has not progressed (especially since I started the journal in [a recent visit to] Spain and it's just too bittersweet to start again right now), but I have been meeting those creative goals. So I'm not sure whether it's a yes or no in your book!</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>Nope.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I think so! My goal was to be and produce more creativity and I think I'm doing that.</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>So far, nope!</p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="mar-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I changed my approach, but it wasn't an active 'i must do A, B, C, etc.' Essentially instead of bullet journaling, I got a planner (on sale, I couldn't resist haha) that has bullet points for days, and I use that to journal.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Not daily. I do think I've added more to my usual free-time activities, but I wouldn't say I changed my routine.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>I think so! I finally finished an application to teach a hand-lettering workshop at work, which involved reworking some small lettering pieces, and I have continued to either illustrate or hand-letter to keep up my creative output.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>Not at all! Actually I'm surprised that I've kept up with my resolution, granted it was an abstract one to keep up creative output/energy.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yes!</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Well I guess so. It's not a negative one, but I am always surprised when I fill out this survey and am honestly able to say that I have been progressing, even if it is in unexpected ways.</p>

    <div class="apr-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Nope! I have signed up for a class if that counts.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>I have practiced lettering more, though it's maybe only 3-5 times a week.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>I think so! I've begun to show mastery over tools that I did not have confidence in earlier this year.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>Nope!</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yes, and I have added a goal of doing some sort of lettering or calligraphy freelance work by the end of the year.</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Nope!</p>

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Nope.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Sort of. I am noticing that on my days off, I will go to a cafe and work on my handwriting, journaling, etc.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>I think so! I think reporting back to you every month has made me aware that I actually am being creatively productive. I am setting extra goals, like writing table cards (for money) by the end of the year.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>Not really.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p> Yep!</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Sort of, I think I'm just paying more attention to myself. It's definitely a positive impact!</p>

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Nope.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Not especially. I do more lettering than I did last year I guess?</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Yes. I actually approached a potential client but it fell through. I also purchased table cards to make samples with, though I haven't completed them yet.</p>

    <div class="jul-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Nopee.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Not particularly. I have always used my free time to do creative things, I guess the difference is what kind of creative thing I do. I do more lettering and journaling now.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Yes. I've contacted several people who seemed to be interested in getting hand-written table cards, and my friend's sister is definitely having me do them for her wedding!</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>A little. I've added a goal of completing one hand-lettering job by the end of the year (though end of summer was ideal) and I think I'm on track to accomplishing that.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yes, though I think my original "resolution" of being more creative everyday was created with a gross underestimation of how much time I spend being creative. I unknowingly set a very low bar for myself, I suppose!</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>I think so. I do not do creative things in order to report on them, but your surveys definitely make me realize that I'm not as wasteful with my free time as I previously thought.</p>
