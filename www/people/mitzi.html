      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I think I have. Just had my annual physical, and the doctor suggested several steps I could take to reduce my weight.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>I started to use an elliptical machine because my treadmill broke. I am doing 10 minutes of regular stepping, and then I alternate high intensity with regular on a minute to minute basis, until I hit 20 minutes total. It is very strenuous for me.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>I have not lost weight, but I think the new machine is toning me up. My clothes feel looser in my hips.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>No, not really. My next target is the visit with the endocrinologist in May. I hope my blood test values look better.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yes!</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Yes, you make me actually write this stuff down in an organized way. I would not think about it so much if I did not have a "diary".</p>

      <p>Yes. In fact, I seem to be recharged this month.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Doctor wants high intensity interval exercise, so my time on a machine is actually shorter than before.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>My weight had crept up but now is where it should be. New exercise seems to be improving my body shape.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>I have a blood test coming up--that is incentive.</p>
