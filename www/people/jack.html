      <h3>How do you feel about the idea of New Year Resolutions?</h3>
      <p>I've generally shied away from them in the past because it always seemed unrealistic to believe that I'd stick to something I set out to do in January. Nowadays, I think that it's important to take chances to set small goals, push your limits, and hold yourself accountable.</p>

      <h3>What is your 2016 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>This year, I plan to listen to more music - and make time to really dive into it. Expand my record collection, get a better sound system, find new ways to discover what's out there, etc.</p>

      <h3>Do you think you will accomplish this resolution by the end of December 2017?</h3>
      <p>I do think I'll accomplish this resolution this year - mostly because the goal and metrics that define it are pretty vague.</p>

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I haven't quite outlined steps to accomplish my resolution as much as I have outlined how to track my progress on my resolution. I've been keeping tabs in a note on my phone.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>My daily routine hasn't changed but I would say that I actively work toward achieving my goal because I'm trying to hold myself accountable. I listen to more full albums, even if I don't like the music at first. I've read more music blogs. And I've tried to listen to vinyl more often than not.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Well, in the sense that it can be measured? yes. so far this year (since I've been tracking it), I've listened to 15 new albums and 43 albums on vinyl.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>I think it bears a little weight but I'm not too worried about exposing myself to new music. I just think I should pick up the pace a bit.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yes!</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>I think your involvement makes me consider why I made my 2017 resolution and forces me to take more time to work toward my goals.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Yes! I've listened to 60 albums this year, although that's far less than I'd like!</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
