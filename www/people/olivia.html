      <h3>How do you feel about the idea of New Year Resolutions?</h3>
      <p>I feel like New Year's resolutions are like fortune cookies or horoscopes, or like giving something up for Lent (if that applies to you). It's kind of an optimistic gesture for the new year but not really something anyone ends up keeping or following through. I actually like the idea of new year resolutions as a kind of "It's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11:11_(numerology)' target='_blank'>11:11</a>, make a wish" offering as the year changes.</p>

      <h3>What is your 2016 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I want to finish a writing project I am working on and actually edit it/push it towards agents to pursue publication.</p>

      <h3>Do you think you will accomplish this resolution by the end of December 2017?</h3>
      <p>I can definitely get it written, edits are the hard part for me so we'll see about the rest!</p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="feb-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>No steps but I do have an plot outline for my project and have had the same routine of writing every night for like 10 years.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>No - see above. Though previously I might have been less strict about it - just writing when I have a chance. Now I really set aside about an hour or more if I can swing it and don't get distracted.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>About 10,000+ words of progress thus far.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>I do feel less bad about staying in all the time in the winter and have more time to write but I'm not a cold weather person so I get lazy. I used to sit outside and write when I was in high school on nice weather days so that's obviously something I can't do in the winter. I'd say it balances out, so not much impact.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Fo sho.</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>I feel a bit more accountable to finish the project and it does help to have a goal to work towards. It's also helping me to realize how much time I really have to work on this - I am very used to thinking that anything I write or work on needs to be done ASAP because I'm crazy and feel like all windows of opportunity are always like two seconds away from closing. So knowing that this is only the first update and I feel like I've gotten some good work done is actually really helpful in a "calm down" kind of way.</p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="mar-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I've revised my outlines for the story but as of now the only steps are A) write and B) don't get too fixated on revision while writing the first draft. That always messes me up because then I never get past revising the same first 5 chapters. So I'm keeping notes on what I want to change but mostly forging ahead. (though I did have a brief block this last week or so where I had something I wanted to change and couldn't really mentally get myself past it so I went ahead and started my revision folder and just indicated in each chapter what the changes would be without writing the full chapters).</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>I now come home from work, eat dinner, maybe watch something and then try to dedicate an hour at least from 9-10 or 10-11 to writing but it does often feel like I come from work and go right back to work so I sometimes give myself a day to not do it. I've been thinking about how nice it would really be to take a bunch of time off from work so that I could dedicate full time energy to writing and what I'd get done but HA I have billz to pay.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Yep! Though maybe not as much as I'd like. (see above)</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>Yes, if it's cold I just want to lay down and not do anything LOL</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yes and I'm actually having a goal within a goal which is to finish the first draft by end of June/ start of Summer. And begin second draft/send it to some readers (friend/family) to complete over the summer and start finalizing some things for a big revision for fall.</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>This one hasn't changed since last month - yes, though I do admit that I'm a compulsive writer. I've been writing something every day since I was 11 so even without the resolution goal I'd be writing something, either aimlessly or with vision. The difference now is that I'm pinning myself to one project which is hard because I have already thought of 2 other projects I'd like to work on at some point. I just have to keep myself focused on one project at a time.</p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="apr-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Same outline: just writing stuff, working on thangs, trying not to revise too soon so that I get bogged down with early edits. Just forging onward to finish draft 1.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Daily routine is the same, though I've tried recently to get up earlier to try writing in the morning and that has been pretty nice though not really sustainable because I HATE MORNINGS.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Yes. I've just reached a critical part in the plot. I feel like much of what I've been writing thus far has been character development/backstory and now I'm reaching the first big plot hurdle.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>I am generally more motivated in spring/summer to do anything so I do feel energized and it's easier for me to wake up in the mornings when it's warm so I should be able to try waking up early to write more.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>YEAH SON</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Yes - I was literally thinking about this the other day because I was kind of putting off writing after work and I was like "Well i need to make some progress for the goal thing" so i write like 2 sentences lol BUT ITS BETTER THAN NOTHING!</p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="may-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>General plan is to finish first rough draft within the next 2 weeks and start second draft/read through for the summer.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Not much. Trying to write every day, doesn't always happen but definitely am trying to put away time for it.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Measurable progress in page numberz son.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>It feels like I have more time in the day because it's not pitch black when I leave work so that helps motivate me to not go home and do nothing the rest of the night.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Ya.</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Ya.</p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="jun-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I've planned "phases" more than an outline. I'm almost done with the first draft and the plan is to read through/2nd draft over the summer. Next fall work on really wrapping it up.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>When I get home, I maybe watch some tv but then after about 9pm I write for an hour or maybe 2 and then read lol So what's changed is that I'm not spending the night just watching tv or just reading, which is what I used to do.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Yes, almost done with 1st rough draft.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>Now it does just because of answer to question 1 ^. I'm conscious of the fact that the year is half up so I'm trying to put in more time - or not necessarily more time but more focus/quality into the time I spend.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yes.</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Yes a) because I'm checking in on progress every month and b) because I find myself talking myself out of self doubt. The goal initially was to aim to potentially shop the manuscript around and because I have <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome' target='_blank'>imposter syndrome</a> and a prodigy disorder thing, I always talk myself out of whatever I'm working on. I tend to halfway through start to say that it's not very original and there are better works out there and it would never be published and that just because I was once good at writing doesn't mean that what people said at the time was true - big fish little pond kind of thing. I always for whatever reason put pressure on myself to write something literary - like because in the past teachers and adults used to say that I was going to be a best seller some day, I ingrained somewhere that if I write what I want to write that it's not of the caliber they're expecting. So I convince myself that whatever I'm working on isn't good, isn't #Literary, and then I don't finish it or don't bother with a re-write. It's like saying to yourself "Well, if it's not the Mona Lisa, then what's the point?" which is ridiculous. So because of the resolution thing, I'm kind of trying to force that out of my system and just work on whatever the thing ends up being, which is def not a Literary Classic but it's fun and I like it and while I like my day job, I'm coming to terms with the fact that what I've wanted to do since I was about 10 is write and I've always had a feeling that it's what I'd end up doing if I just give myself the time to sit and do it and start. I'm going to quit my job (LOL no IM NOT)</p>

    <div class="jul-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yep - got an outline of the plot and a schedule for revisions.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Kind of; now that I'm in revision stage 2 I'm having some trouble, which I always do once I'm done with a first draft. So I'm trying to keep writing but I find myself wanting to write at odd hours, like 1 am, which isn't conducive to work/life balance.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Draft 1 done, making my way slowly through that draft to fill out the story, write in scenes I left out, etc. After that, which hopefully I'll be done with by October, I'll do a read through, reorganize the chapters and hopefully start finalizing.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>Dead of summer makes me just want to watch anime LOL or read books my favorite books so I end up spending my free time doing either of those things instead of writing.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yes, though I'm now in the frustration point of things for me. I'm never good at working on something once I've already done a first draft. I've always been a one and done person with everything - I always try to get it right the first time so I don't have to do it again or read it again. Not conducive to writing a longer form thing so I'm trying to just work through it</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Yes, but because I'm a psycho it's sort of taking a negative turn haha I had a teacher in high school who was my creative writing/AP lit teacher and each year she gave out these like awards that were personalized per student. My senior year she gave me the "Best Seller 2019" award which was super nice and really amazing at the time but as more time passed and I wasn't motivated or was just kind letting time slip by, I got really anxious about that because I started to look at it as a deadline and like if I didn't reach that benchmark, then I'd failed in some way. THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH CHILD PRODIGY SYNDROME lol and now I'm very not-confident about anything I do and also very stressed about time. So while I like kind of having this consistent project to work on, I'm also starting to stress myself out because I'm seeing the upcoming new year as a deadline - but at least I'm now self aware enough to understand that this is just me talking to myself. That nobody expects anything crazy or like my status as a success or failure is hinging on this.</p>
