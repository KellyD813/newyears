      <h3>How do you feel about the idea of New Year Resolutions?</h3>
      <p>Not a strong opinion.</p>

      <h3>What is your 2016 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Develop a new hobby to help reduce stress.</p>

      <h3>Do you think you will accomplish this resolution by the end of December 2017?</h3>
      <p>I do, and am looking forward to becoming interested and proficient in something new.</p>

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yes, however the steps are pretty short. Waiting for a particular sale to occur before purchasing the console.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Only in the sense that I am more aware of what games are coming out in anticipation.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Money is saved up for the right time.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>No, which is nice. Also the point of this particular resolution. Something that is more of a harmless hobby.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yes.</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Good reminders to check for that sale.</p>

    <div class="mar-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>The goal was to buy a gaming system for myself, so not many steps.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Yes, after work now I eat dinner and instead of continuing more work from the office I play a game with my brother and friends. Nice way to disconnect for a bit.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Yes, kind of went overboard and ended up with two gaming consoles to make it possible to play with family and friends who might own a different system. Went from 0 to 2 very quickly.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>No, the resolution has been accomplished and it's just fun.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yes, I hope to maintain a routine of playing with friends and family a few times a week.</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Yes, work can be pretty consuming so being reminded of just going out and making the purchase helped.</p>

    <div class="apr-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Negative.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Quite dramatically. I now play video games almost every day. It has been nice to disconnect for a while.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>I guess measurable. Went from 0 days of the week playing games to 7.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>Seeing as the goal was not particularly difficult to accomplish. Now just enjoying another way to relax.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I plan to continue relaxing via games if that counts. I do plan on digging more into new games after completing the ones I've started.</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Yeah, goes back to the reminder of saving up and making the purchase. I'm glad I've done it and the reminder was nice.</p>

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I did not.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Still playing games almost daily. Still enjoying taking a step away from work and real world stuff. Just recently organized a specific session with people.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>It has been measurable. Before the resolution, didn't playing anything. Playing 7 days a week for the most part.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>By this time in the year, my conscience is free. Seeing that it is now such a part of my routine, often don't remember it was a resolution.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I see no reason not to continue my new routine. I did think by now I would have finished some and moved on to new games. However still playing the original games I purchased.</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>It did. My resolution had very low barrier so once I purchased the system and games wasn't much preventing me from continuing.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Playing the same two games almost daily. The organized gaming session happened. Prob won't do it again though, kind of a mess in the game and we weren't successful.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Same measurement. Playing 7 days a week.</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>It did. My resolution was technically very easy to accomplish.</p>
