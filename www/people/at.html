      <h3>How do you feel about the idea of New Year Resolutions?</h3>
      <p>I think that a younger me romanticized it, a recent me scoffed at my personal inability to follow through and unkindly projected that onto other people silently, and me in my current Pok√©mon evolution doesn't want to be so sour.</p>

      <h3>What is your 2016 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I want to read a 1.5 books/month, so 18 books in the year.</p>

      <h3>Do you think you will accomplish this resolution by the end of December 2017?</h3>
      <p>I definitely want to try and love this idea of holding one another accountable. I used to so badly want to be in a book club with friends but maybe it'll be easier if I start with myself first.</p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="feb-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Not in particular. I just think about how I need to read more. I suppose I've been using <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/' target='_blank'>Goodreads</a> to track what I'm working through at the moment.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Yeah, I think my daily routine has gone back to something more akin to what I did as a teenager. I try to carry books around with me more. Admittedly, it's still easier to listen to a podcast on the subway, but it's definitely on my mind. At night in particular, I try to read some before I fall asleep now.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Yeah, definitely!</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>Yeah, this goal is definitely towards the forefront of my thoughts now.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yep!</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Yeah, I've really enjoyed having a bit of an anchor, even if it's more hands off than I originally imagined.</p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="mar-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Not in particular, other than to just read whenever I can, particularly before I go to bed.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Yeah, definitely think about the books I'm reading more.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Yeah! I just finished my 4th of the year. What a doozie. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancillary_Justice' target='_blank'>Ancillary Justice by Ann Leslie</a>.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>Yeah, for sure. I just counted and definitely am motivated to perhaps get ahead on my goal of 1.5 books a month.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yeah!</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Was just thinking of your email coming soon in fact. Excited to talk to you next time we hang out.</p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="apr-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Recently I was thinking that I maybe aught to do so, but really I just know that when I'm just lying down in bed, instead of reaching for my phone to look at Youtube, I should just grab my book instead. Outside of that, I don't know if I need to outline anything per se?</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Yeah, I think I just think about books a lot more like I used to.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Yeah! Though this past month wasn't as great.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>Sure. I was falling behind, so I went and picked up a book that I knew I would devour yesterday. It's the second book in the series by Ann Leckie, Ancillary Sword.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yeah, for sure.</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Yeah, I always look forward to getting this [survey] and getting to talk to you in person about how the project is going, my goals, yours, etc.</p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="may-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I finished that book I mentioned I bought last month because I felt myself lagging. Been trying to end each night with reading away from the phone.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Yeah, while my morning commute isn't super good for reading books, I've thought about bringing some magazines that I also subscribed to to get more reading in. Recently, I started studying again every night (though not the initial goal, I remembered how much I used to say I'd want to get on Jeopardy at some point in my life).</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>For sure. I'm a bit behind on my book count as a hard number but some books have been longer than others I suppose.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>Yeah! I need to catch up regardless of what I said above ha.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yup!</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Definitely, like I've said this whole time I'm really appreciative for these check-ins.</p>

    <div class="jun-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Right now I just try to write it down along with my daily goals. Bullet Journaling, eh.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Yeah, I'm always thinking about how behind I am in reading. Though, it seems like it's also given me more to talk about with people which is always a plus.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Yeah, I think so. Like I said behind, but definitely ahead of last year.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>ALL THE TIME. Thanks, Kelly. ;P</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yes.</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely!</p>
