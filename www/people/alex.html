      <h3>How do you feel about the idea of New Year Resolutions?</h3>
      <p>I'm not too fond of New Year's resolutions, because most of the time you want to achieve something unattainable, then disappointed when you don't accomplish said resolution. I like making small "resolutions" throughout the year that I can achieve.</p>

      <h3>What is your 2016 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Clean out closet and consign belongings every 3 months.</p>

      <h3>Do you think you will accomplish this resolution by the end of December 2017?</h3>
      <p>YES! I'm starting already, little by little.</p>
