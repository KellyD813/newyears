      <h3>How do you feel about the idea of New Year Resolutions?</h3>
      <p>As I was sitting down to write this, making my decision on my New Year's resolution I instantly had a bad taste in my mouth. "This stuff is for the people who lack discipline". My next thought was "wow why would I default to such a negative stance on this?" </p>

      <h3>What is your 2016 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Then it became clear. I'm afraid to make demands on myself. Well, here’s to being afraid and going for it. My new year’s resolution is to stop avoiding calls, texts, emails or other forms of communication and to respond in a timely manner. I'd like to say procrastination but it really only pertains to avenues of communication.</p>

      <h3>Do you think you will accomplish this resolution by the end of December 2017?</h3>
      <p>I am hopeful I will meet the mark but I do have to admit that this failed goal crosses my mind just about every week. But since I've put it out there, heck... maybe this is my time!</p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="feb-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Wow, now I feel lazy. I have not outlined any steps in accomplishing this goal. It tends to be more of a mental hurdle consisting of "just do it now becca". So rather than steps, it's more black and white.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>I wouldn't say my daily routine has changed, like I said it's mainly a mental game of making a split second decision to do the task right then.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>I would say I get back to texts, voice mails, emails in a day or two (except for this lol) rather than my usual weeks.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>Yes, but not because of the new year. I am 9 weeks away from being a mom so I'm striving to be more organized and prompt.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yes! I'm making more and more of an effort. I've realized that the longer I wait to respond, the quicker I forget about doing it at all especially with pregnant brain.</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Well considering part of this experiment is getting back to you via email, yes! lol although I have to say I'm a little embarrassed that your emails have taken me the longest to respond to. But yes, knowing someone is watching makes the stakes higher.</p>

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I have not taken the time to outline steps to accomplish my resolutions.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>I feel like it's getting better and better with my voicemails and text messages. I have to tell myself, just respond now and that little mantra seems to give me just enough push.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Considering I don't have any red demon numbers plaguing me on my iPhone screen, I'd say that is measurable! It usually says zero texts and voicemails.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>March doesn't intimidate me any more than January did. Then again, I've been very distracted so if I had done this last year it may have taken up more mental space.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Yes! I very much enjoy not having the weight of answering people "later".</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>Hey big brother, stop watching me. :) Yes I think it helps knowing I'll get these questions every month.</p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="apr-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I have not outlined any steps to accomplish this goal.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>I am starting to get into the stride of waking up and checking my phone and email first thing to see what I need to do, answer or clean out. Normally I "get around to it".</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>I have no outstanding text messages, voicemails, or emails!</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>I am about to give birth so I feel like this month has definitely been about getting everything done and checked off the list. I think this has given me the extra push to be more diligent about communication outlets.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>Oh boy I sure hope so. I'm not sure what storm I'm about to enter but let's hope I have enough time to check a dang email.</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>At first I think it did but now the motivations have been from my own accord.</p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="may-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I haven't outlined steps but again, it's just having the responsibility of getting back to people in a prompt manner.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>Well now it's all a mess :) my daily routine usually doesn't consist of checking my emails anymore. I was doing so well and now it's taken a back seat.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>I had no red dots notifications on my iPhone and now I have a few.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>May has been crazy. I couldn't even stand for a while so I definitely wasn't checking my phone.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I plan on getting back on track as soon as I move back home and Ryder [the new baby] is a bit older! I liked having all my ducks in a row and it felt less chaotic when I didn't have anything waiting on me.</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>I completely forgot about my goal until I got your email, so yes! I can refocus and get back on track.</p>
    </div>

    
    <div class="jun-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>No need to outline them anymore. It's clear what I need to do to keep to the resolution. Check my darn phone.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>I was initially waking up and checking my email or text messages and responding immediately. The key was making sure to do it every day to stay on top of it.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>I was doing so well, and then I had my baby and had some health scares. I still only have a few emails and I have no voicemails.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>This month is just like any month. Getting back to people is just as important this time of year :)</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I do like having a clean plate so to speak but it's been so hard staying on top of it all with a new baby. Being a mom is exhausting and getting back to people is one more thing I have to do. Listening to the voice mail or figuring out the time to meet and texting back is mentally wearing. It sounds really dumb, how hard could it be. But at the end of the day, I think "nope, I'm going to bed"</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>At this point I wish it weighed on me more heavily so I could stay motivated!</p>

    <div class="jul-container hide">

      <h3>Have you outlined steps to accomplish your 2017 New Year Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I have not outlined any new steps to accomplish this goal.</p>

      <h3>Has your daily routine changed in any way because of your 2017 goal?</h3>
      <p>My daily routine has drastically changed now but not due to the goal. I used to wake up and check all my emails and voicemails and now I tend to my baby instead and look at it all later.</p>

      <h3>Has measurable progress been made on achieving your goal?</h3>
      <p>Surprisingly, I don’t have any unheard voicemails or unanswered texts so that is an improvement to my usual build up.</p>

      <h3>At the time of this survey, we are nearing the end of the month. Does the time of year bear any weight on your conscience regarding your goal?</h3>
      <p>This time of year does bear a little weight to my goal because I'm moving so the urgency to check my phone is more than any other time previously. I am also going back to work so I need to stay on top of movers, clients, etc.</p>

      <h3>Do you plan to continue your path towards achieving your 2017 Resolution?</h3>
      <p>I still like the resolution I have made for myself and I plan on continuing. It is definitely more of habit to stay on top of my phone than it was before the start of this year.</p>

      <h3>Does my involvement make any impact on your feelings/resolution progress?</h3>
      <p>I would say these emails are a good reminder. Every time I fill out [a survey] I remember how important it once was to achieve this goal.</p>
